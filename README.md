## üîß Configuration

The dashboard supports configuration for multiple cloud providers:

```typescript
// Mock configuration - replace with actual API credentials
const cloudConfig = {
  aws: {
    region: 'us-east-1',
    costExplorerEnabled: true,
    cloudWatchEnabled: true
  },
  azure: {
    subscriptionId: 'your-subscription-id',
    costManagementEnabled: true
  },
  gcp: {
    projectId: 'your-project-id',
    billingAccount: 'your-billing-account'
  }
};
```

## üìà Key Metrics Tracked

- **Cost Metrics**: Total spend, daily/monthly/yearly trends, cost per service
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU utilization, memory usage, storage utilization
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Cost per unit, waste percentage, optimization potential
- **Compliance Metrics**: Budget adherence, policy violations, security costs

## ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual spending patterns using statistical models
- **Forecasting**: Predicts future costs based on historical data and trends
- **Optimization**: ML-powered recommendations for resource right-sizing
- **Alerting**: Intelligent alerts that reduce noise and focus on actionable insights

## üöÄ Deployment

This dashboard is designed to be deployed on modern hosting platforms:

- **Netlify**: Automatic deployments from Git
- **Vercel**: Optimized for React applications
- **AWS Amplify**: Native AWS integration
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment option

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys and credentials should be stored securely using environment variables
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for production use
- Use HTTPS for all communications with cloud provider APIs
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
